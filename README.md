# Robust nets
Pytorch  implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Doll√°r.

Along with additions form [Sorting out Lipschitz function approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05381) to ensure the network is lipschitz continuous.

This implementation is primarily designed to be easy to read and simple to modify.
